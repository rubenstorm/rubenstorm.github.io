An online store is a website where you can buy and sell goods or services over the Internet. This section provides links to various online stores and platforms where you can set up your own shop. For information about my own internet stores, please refer to another page.

## Go Shopping
### Amazon

If you shop on Amazon through my link, I’ll earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. Note that this link is only available to residents of Germany.

Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, started as a book-selling platform and has grown into a major player in e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.
