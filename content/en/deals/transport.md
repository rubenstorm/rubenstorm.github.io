Navigating public transit often means finding the most cost-effective options. Whether you need an aircraft, train, bus, cab, scooter, or bike, I’ll share links to the services I’ve tried and found reliable.

## Scooter Rental
### Tier

I use the Tier app for scooter rentals to get around town. Sign up through my link to enjoy 50% off your next five rides, and I’ll also earn a small reward.

## Bus, Train & Flight
### Omio

For traveling longer distances, I rely on Omio to book trains and buses. It often offers better prices than Deutsche Bahn or Flixbus. While I haven’t used Omio for flights yet, it’s worth checking out. Sign up through my link to get a €10 discount on your next booking.
