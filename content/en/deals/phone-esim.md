# Phone & eSim

An eSIM is a digital SIM card that lets you activate a cellular plan with your carrier without needing a physical SIM card. This means I can download the eSIM as I travel to new destinations and have immediate network access upon arrival. It's incredibly convenient for using Maps, Navigation, Uber, or Bolt, and I don‚Äôt want to miss out on this luxury.
