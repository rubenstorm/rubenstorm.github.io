**Support My Work**
## SafePal Donations

If you'd like to support me, you can donate anonymously to my BSC wallet below. If you prefer to use a different cryptocurrency or donation method, just scroll down for more options.

### Important Information
> Please ensure you select the correct coin and network when making your donation. Sending coins or tokens to the wrong network could lead to their permanent loss.

Cryptocurrency donations are anonymous—I can only see the wallet address from which they were sent. If you want me to know who you are, feel free to reach out.
