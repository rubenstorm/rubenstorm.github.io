**Support My Work**

## Donate via Cronos

You can make an anonymous donation to my Cronos wallet using the details provided below. If you prefer a different cryptocurrency or donation method, just scroll down for more options.

### Important Note
> Ensure you select the correct coin and network when making a donation. Sending funds to the wrong network will result in permanent loss.

Cryptocurrency donations are anonymousâ€”I can only see the wallet address they were sent from. If you'd like me to know who you are, please reach out.
