You can make anonymous donations in TRX (Tron) to the wallet address provided below. If you prefer to use a different cryptocurrency or have another donation plan in mind, please scroll down for additional options.

### Important Information
> Ensure you select the correct coin and network when making your donation. Sending your coins or tokens to an incorrect network will result in permanent loss.

Cryptocurrency donations are anonymous, and I can only see the wallet address from which the donation was made. If you wish to identify yourself, please let me know.
