I want to extend my deepest gratitude to everyone who has supported me along the way. Whether youâ€™ve helped in big or small ways, your encouragement means the world to me. Thank you for being a part of my journey and for following me on social media. Your support is truly appreciated!

**Support My Work!**

If you enjoy the videos and photos I share on social media, please know that I do this work out of passion, not for payment. As a minimalist nomad constantly on the move, I rely on your support to continue creating. If my content resonates with you and youâ€™d like to show your appreciation, a small tip via PayPal or cryptocurrency would mean a lot to me. Thank you so much for your support!

## Got a Lightning wallet? Like zapping?

You can send me some sats using the link below â€” choose between Lightning, on-chain, or other available options.

**Note:** eCash isn't fully tested yet â€” if you use it, you might need to send me the redemption string so I can claim it.

âš¡ [Send some Sats](https://coinos.io/rubenstorm)

You can also use my Lightning address (it looks like an email, but it doesnâ€™t receive messages â€” only sats).

âš¡ rubenstorm@coinos.io

Thanks for the zap! âš¡ðŸ’›
