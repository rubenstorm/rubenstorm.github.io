**Support My Journey**

You can contribute anonymously to my Bitcoin wallet using the details below. If you prefer a different cryptocurrency or donation method, just scroll down a bit for more options.

### Important Reminder
> Please double-check that you’ve selected the correct coin and network before making your donation. Sending funds to the wrong network could result in a permanent loss.

Cryptocurrency donations are anonymous—I’ll only see the wallet address they were sent from. If you’d like me to know who you are, feel free to get in touch.

## Donate Bitcoin
