## Why did you decide to live a nomadic life? 
My nomadic journey began as a response to challenging circumstances at my former fixed residence, prompting me to explore my roots.

## How do you finance your life as a nomad?
I finance my lifestyle through various sources, including occasional support from my community.

## Which countries have you visited so far, and which are your favorites?
I have traveled to over 40 countries, including Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, and Kenya. My favorites vary, but each destination has its own unique charm.

## What advice do you have for people considering a nomadic lifestyle?
Before embarking on a nomadic life, it's important to plan carefully rather than diving headfirst into the adventure as I did. Adapting to change and maintaining a healthy balance is crucial. It's essential to remain open to new experiences and embrace the diversity of the world.
