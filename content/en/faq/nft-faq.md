An NFT is a tradeable digital asset recorded on a blockchain. It can be associated with specific items like photos, art, music, or sports highlights and may include license rights for its use. NFTs are bought and sold on digital markets, but their ownership transfers are often informal and lack legal enforcement, typically serving more as status symbols than legally binding assets. 

## What is NFT?
NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are non-replicable cryptographic tokens that reside on a blockchain. NFTs can represent physical assets such as artwork and real items. By “tokenizing” these real-world tangible goods, you may make purchasing, selling, and trading them more efficient while lowering the risk of fraud.

## Are NFT worth buying?
Is it a good idea to invest in NFTs? Investing in an asset solely because it has been tokenized into an NFT is a bad idea. NFTs are not investments in and of themselves, therefore be sure you understand the value of the underlying asset before purchasing the NFT.

## What are NFT used for?
NFTs are tokens that can be used to indicate ownership of one-of-a-kind goods. They enable us to tokenize items such as art, valuables, and even real estate. The Ethereum blockchain secures asset ownership; no one can change the record of ownership or copy/paste a new NFT into existence. NFT is an abbreviation for non-fungible token.

## Can a NFT be fake?
Real NFTs will have properties displayed, whereas fake NFTs will not. Next, double-check the contract address of your chosen NFT. This will reveal where it was coined. A phony NFT store may display an inaccurate minting address, whereas a true one will display the exact location where the coin was created. 

## Can I touch a NFT?
An NFT is a digital asset that lives entirely in the digital universe—it cannot be touched, yet it may be owned.
