## About  
### Travel & Lifestyle

For over six years, I’ve been living a nomadic life, moving from place to place without a permanent home. My Instagram journey started before this era, but it has evolved significantly since. My travels weren’t planned, and minimalism came naturally, but you can follow it all on Instagram and draw your own conclusions.

Please note that my work isn’t monetized. All the photos I take and reels I create are shared without any financial reward. If you’d like to support me, consider making a PayPal donation, a cryptocurrency contribution, or a monthly subscription on my Patreon page.
