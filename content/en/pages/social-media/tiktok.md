### On TikTok

TikTok is my latest social platform, so you'll find fewer posts here than on Instagram. I switch between German and English in my TikTok videos, depending on my mood. One of my most popular videos has garnered over 405,000 views. Join my TikTok community, watch my latest videos, and show some love by giving them a like.

## About
### Travel & Lifestyle

For over seven years, I’ve been living a nomadic lifestyle, moving from one country to the next without a permanent home. A few years into my travels, I started documenting my experiences on social media, with TikTok being my latest platform. Follow me there to explore my minimalist lifestyle and see the beautiful places I visit.

Please note that I’m not compensated for my work. I create all my TikTok videos without any financial reward. If you’d like to support me, consider making a PayPal donation, sending a cryptocurrency gift, or subscribing to my Patreon.
