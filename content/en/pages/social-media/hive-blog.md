### Hive Blog

After 7 years of travel, I was looking for a way to share my experiences while earning a bit of income. I discovered Nostr, a decentralized platform similar to Twitter, and through it, I found Hive—a place where I could receive tips for my blogging. I decided to move my blog from my website to Hive. Since my website was sparse, I closed it and started fresh with Hive. If you're interested in starting your own Hive Blog, I’ve included an invitation link for you to explore.

## About
### Travel & Lifestyle

For more than seven years, I’ve lived a nomadic lifestyle, constantly moving without a permanent home. My Hive Blog captures this journey and the minimalist lifestyle that evolved from it. The blog allows you to follow my ongoing adventure and draw your own conclusions.

Please note, I don’t earn from my photos or content. If you enjoy what you see, a small tip or upvote on Hive would be appreciated. If you’re interested in creating your own Hive Blog and receiving tips, feel free to use my invitation link for a complimentary blog.
