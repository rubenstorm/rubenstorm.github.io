## 📬 Contact

I value privacy, openness, and decentralization.  
That’s why I don’t use traditional centralized messaging platforms.

Instead, you can reach me through open, federated, and privacy-respecting communication networks. These systems are not controlled by a single company, give users ownership of their identity, and support secure, independent communication.

**Primary contact methods (preferred):**

---

### 🔐 SimpleX

SimpleX is a privacy-first messaging network with no user identifiers and no global directory.  
It is designed to minimize metadata and maximize anonymity.

➡ Use SimpleX to contact me securely and directly.

👉 [Message me on SimpleX](https://smp14.simplex.im/a#b1Uc8wkNLS3aD-7oIdkZzqMRFa4x18XuGJNL5P-Rchg)


---

### 💬 XMPP (Jabber)

XMPP is a long-standing open messaging protocol based on federation.  
It works similarly to email: you choose a server, but can message users on other servers.

➡ Send me a message using my XMPP address.  
Supports encryption via OMEMO.

💬 You can reach me on XMPP here: [rubenstorm@c0nnect.de](xmpp:rubenstorm@c0nnect.de)

### 🌐 Matrix

Matrix is a modern decentralized communication network for real-time messaging.  
It supports federation, end-to-end encryption, and cross-server communication.

➡ You can reach me via my Matrix ID.

💬 You can reach me on Matrix here: [@rubenstorm:nope.chat](https://matrix.to/#/@rubenstorm:nope.chat)

## 🌍 Alternative Contact (Social Protocols)

While the methods above are the only guaranteed contact channels, you may also reach out via decentralized social networks:

- **Fediverse** — You can send me a private message if our instances federate.
- **Nostr** — Direct messages are possible if you know my public key.

---

### ✨ Why these platforms?

- No central authority  
- Interoperable and open standards  
- Privacy-respecting by design  
- User-controlled identity  
- Future-proof communication  

If you care about digital autonomy too, we’ll get along great 🙂
