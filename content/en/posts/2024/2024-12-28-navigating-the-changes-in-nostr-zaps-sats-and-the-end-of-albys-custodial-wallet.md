**Navigating the Changes in Nostr: Zaps, Sats, and the End of Alby’s Custodial Wallet**

Today, I want to dive into a technical issue that’s been on my mind lately. If you’re familiar with **Nostr**, you’ll know it’s a decentralized protocol somewhat akin to X (formerly Twitter). Unlike X, though, Nostr isn’t a platform — it’s a protocol, which means it’s open and flexible, with various clients to use.

In Nostr, you can receive both **likes** and **zaps** (which are small amounts of Bitcoin sent using the Lightning Network). You’ll find a wide range of features on Nostr, such as long-form content via **NIP-23** or **Pinstr**, a tool for sharing photos. But today, I want to focus on zaps: sending and receiving **Sats** (short for Satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin).

For my transactions, I’ve been using **Alby**, a custodial Lightning wallet. The zaps are processed through the Lightning Network, and I’ve relied on **Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC)** to link my wallet to my Nostr account. It’s been a simple and efficient system — until now.

## The Problem

Alby recently announced they’re discontinuing their custodial wallet service. They’re transitioning to the **Alby Hub**, a non-custodial system that requires users to essentially run their own Lightning node. While this move aligns with the principles of decentralization, it comes with additional costs: roughly $12/month for hosting the node.

For someone like me, who doesn’t generate significant income from zaps on Nostr, this expense is hard to justify. I suspect many others are in the same boat, grappling with how to adapt to this change.

## Seeking a Solution

At the moment, I’m still searching for a viable alternative. The simplicity and accessibility of Alby’s custodial wallet made it a great solution for users like me, who aren’t earning much through Nostr. It’s disappointing to see it go, though I understand the financial challenges of maintaining such a service.

For now, I’m reaching out to the community. Are there other Nostr users out there who have found effective solutions to this issue? Perhaps you’ve discovered a cost-effective way to manage your Lightning wallet or a workaround that doesn’t require running your own node. If so, I’d love to hear your insights.

## Final Thoughts

While I’m saddened by the end of Alby’s custodial wallet, I remain hopeful that the Nostr community’s ingenuity will lead to new, user-friendly solutions. In the meantime, I’ll continue exploring my options and sharing what I learn along the way.

If you have any suggestions or experiences to share, tweet the link to this post on X (formerly Twitter) or post it on Nostr. Make sure to tag me and include your comment so I can see your feedback. Let’s figure this out together!
