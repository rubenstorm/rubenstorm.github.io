### Exploring Moshi: Cafés, Challenges, and Plans Ahead

Yesterday evening, I found myself enjoying a late dinner at the Hostel Bar, followed by diving deeper into exploring a nostr client called Primal. While it promises a partial solution to the issues I’ve been facing with the Alby Custodial Wallet, it’s still not perfect. There are features I’d like to see that are missing, and uploading images — like the ones I’m working on now in a café at the foot of Kilimanjaro — remains a challenge. Primal’s Prime Account is an option, but it doesn’t align with my current needs. If I could generate enough income over nostr to cover itself, I’d consider it, but for now, my search for a solution continues.

This morning, I decided to try a new café, someone recommended to me recently. The ambiance is lovely, and it has a great vibe, though a bit on the pricey side. The cappuccino was delightful, and its proximity to my hostel makes it a convenient spot. I might return, but I’m also intrigued by another recommendation: Aroma Coffee. The name reminds me of Aroma Kava in Ukraine, which I loved. I’ll have to visit it soon and see how it compares.

For today, my plans are simple. I aim to download videos from one cloud storage and transfer them to WeVideo for editing. My video projects have been on my mind, and I’m eager to keep making progress. Additionally, I’m experimenting with setting up VS Code for LaTeX. Currently, I’m drafting this blog post in VS Code using Markdown, but I’ve been inspired to explore LaTeX after reading an article about it. It’s been a while since I used Kile for LaTeX editing, so this will be a relearning experience. My goal is to make VS Code as versatile as possible for my creative and technical needs.

Looking ahead, I’m starting to think about my travel plans for 2025. At the beginning of the year, I’d like to explore new cities, perhaps visit Victoria Falls in Zambia, or even check out Uganda and the Nile’s source. However, I know I’ll eventually loop back to East Africa, with plans to end up in Mombasa. A flight to Germany crossed my mind, but my budget is too tight for that at the moment. Hopefully, in the next couple of days, I’ll have more clarity about my next steps. For now, I need to extend my stay at the hostel, pay my rent, and finalize my plans.

Moshi has been a delightful place to stay. It’s undeniably more picturesque than Kilifi, though each has its charm. While Kilifi boasts beaches, Moshi offers the majestic Kilimanjaro and a plethora of beautiful cafés and restaurants. The streets here are livelier, with newer cars and more spots to relax and soak in the atmosphere.

Unfortunately, I’m temporarily barred from entering Kenya. The border officer informed me that my frequent entries and exits have triggered restrictions. After some time, this should reset, and I’ll be able to return to explore the places I’ve missed.

Speaking of Kenya, I have to mention a surprising development from my time in Kilifi — my psoriasis disappeared. I attribute this to the consistent warm climate, the salty ocean air, and year-round sunshine. I’m optimistic that staying in a warm environment for the next couple of years will keep it away permanently.

Before leaving Moshi, I plan to buy a multipurpose sheet that I can use as a wrap or towel. It fits perfectly with my minimalist lifestyle. I’ve also been contemplating replacing my worn-out T-shirts with something new. While they’re still functional, they’ve seen better days.

I’ll wrap up this post here and wish everyone a beautiful Sunday. Stay tuned for more updates and photos from my day — including snapshots of the café and my walk there. Until next time!
