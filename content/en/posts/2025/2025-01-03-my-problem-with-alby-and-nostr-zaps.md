# My Problem with Alby and Nostr Zaps

I encountered challenges while trying to use Alby and Nostr for sending and receiving zaps. Originally, Alby was a free custodial wallet, but its transition to Alby Hub has introduced changes. Alby Hub is only free if you host it on your own server, which involves additional expenses and a degree of technical expertise. Essentially, using Alby Hub now involves either financial or technical investment.

I initially relied on GetAlby for handling sats on Nostr, a decentralized, censorship-resistant social media protocol. Whenever my GetAlby wallet balance exceeded 10k or 20k sats, I transferred the funds to my Phoenix or Zeus wallet. Both of these are non-custodial wallets, ensuring full control of my Bitcoins — _"not your keys, not your coins."_

To address my issues, I researched alternative solutions and found Minibits, which I connected using NWC (Nostr Wallet Connect). Minibits, though still in experimental, offers a clean design and reliable performance. Thanks to the Minibits team for a great project! Initially, I also considered Coinos, but registration problems prevented me from proceeding. However, after raising the issue on Nostr, Coinos promptly resolved it, and I successfully registered. I plan to explore Coinos further in the future. These projects provide excellent support; posting questions or issues on Nostr often results in quick assistance.

Minibits has proven to be an impressive app with intuitive functionality. NWC works seamlessly with Amethyst and Primal. While I’ve started using Primal as my main client, I’ve experienced errors when posting photos. This issue might be related to my unstable internet connection, but I will keep an eye on it.

Regarding browser extensions, I plan to stick with GetAlby for as long as it continues to function. If necessary, I’ll transition to new solutions as they develop. 

## A Big Thank You to the Nostr Community

I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the entire Nostr community for their incredible support and informations. The guidance I received helped me find solutions to challenges I faced and explore new tools and approaches. Your quick responses to questions, innovative ideas, and commitment to building a decentralized, censorship-resistant ecosystem are truly inspiring.

From addressing technical issues to sharing recommendations, the Nostr community has shown what’s possible when people collaborate and support one another. Thank you for creating a space where innovation thrives, and users can take control of their own digital experiences. Together, we’re shaping a brighter future for decentralized technologies!
