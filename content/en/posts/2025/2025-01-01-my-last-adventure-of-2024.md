## My Last Adventure of 2024

Yesterday marked the final day of 2024, and as promised, I’m sharing the story of how I closed out the year. The day began like most others on the road: shower, breakfast and a cup of coffee. While I was at the hostel’s breakfast area, a man from Switzerland approached me with an invitation. He and two others planned to hike to the waterfalls — a journey I had taken before. The idea was tempting, but I wasn’t keen on paying the 10,000 TZS entrance fee and guide charge of another 10,000 TZS again.

After politely declining, I told them I would walk part of the path with them before heading to a spot for coffee. We hopped into a TukTuk bound for Rau, a small area on the town's border. Upon arrival, I checked the coffee spot only to find it locked and noone there. Adjusting my plan, I decided to accompany them further along the trail toward Materuni, at least to the point where the road steeply ascends.

The walk was hot and challenging. The morning sun bore down relentlessly, and I had neither a hat nor water with me. Halfway along the path, feeling unwell, I wished my companions a good hike and turned back. I realized I’d taken only a couple of photos, so I decided to slow down and immerse myself in the beauty of my surroundings.

## Strolling Through Nature

The walk back turned into a serene, unplanned exploration. I wandered among lush banana trees and rustic roads lined with modest houses. Children played joyfully, elders sat roadside selling fruits and vegetables, and motorbikes and trucks rumbled past, transporting goods to the market. The simplicity of life around me was humbling and beautiful.

The view opened to reveal rolling hills and dense jungle. The scenery was breathtaking —  a vibrant tapestry of farming lands, winding paths, and distant greenery. I paused frequently to soak it all in, taking photos and relishing the quiet moments of solitude.

## Encounters on the Road

As I reached an intersection with a cluster of houses, I was met with shouts from locals offering rides — on taxis or bodas (motorcycle taxis). Politely declining, I continued my walk. A memorable encounter occurred when a boy, no older than 10, arrived on a motorcycle with his older brother seated behind him. The boy barely reached the pedals, and his brother had to stabilize the bike when it stopped. They tried to convince me to hop on for a ride, but I declined and watched them speed off, the boy driving like a seasoned pro.

## Returning to Town

The rest of the walk was peaceful and uneventful. I crossed a river, climbed a hill, and finally entered Moshi. I stopped again at the coffee spot, but it was still locked. Near the main road, where TukTuks gathered, drivers eagerly offered me tours or rides at inflated prices. I opted for a quick, cheap ride back to the hostel for just 700 TZS.

Dehydrated and with a pounding headache, I spent the afternoon resting. Later, I ventured out for dinner: fries with beef shashlik for 4,000 TZS. However, the experience was far from appetizing. The vendor reused dirty plates, wiping them down with an old rag before serving food. It was a stark reminder of the challenges that come with nomadic living.

## Ringing in the New Year

As midnight approached, I joined others outside the hostel to watch the fireworks over Kibo Palace. While the display couldn’t compare to the dazzling New Year’s Eve I once experienced in Odessa, it was a fitting end to another year of exploration. Memories of past celebrations in places like Mardin, Antalya, and Mombasa flooded my mind, but Odessa remains my favorite.
