**Dear Friends and Followers,**  

The year 2024 has been one of the most settled years for me, with less movement than usual. Yet, it has been filled with meaningful moments and progress. I’ve started revamping my WordPress and migrating older posts to my pages on GitHub, embracing a new way to share my journey. Additionally, I’ve been able to work on my vlog again, thanks to a hostel with the best internet connection I’ve had in years! Stay tuned—2025 is shaping up to bring many exciting changes and new projects.  

As we wrap up this year, I want to send you warm wishes for a relaxing and love-filled Christmas, all the way from Moshi, nestled at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro. It feels wonderful to be back in this charming little town that holds a special place in my heart.  

Let’s step into 2025 with renewed energy and optimism, and make it a truly beautiful year.  

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!  
**Ruben Storm**
