Last night, I installed Primal to explore its features. The Primal client has its own wallet functionality, but there's a catch: it provides a lightning address that cannot be customized to your preferred name. To work around this limitation, I used Nostrcheck to forward the zaps from my Nostrcheck address to my Primal address. Now everything looks good on the surface, but the zapper still sees the odd Primal address.

I also discovered that I can't upload images with Primal, though the reason for this is still unclear. This transition might mean moving away from the Amethyst client to the Primal client. While Primal has an appealing interface, it lacks some functions that I’ve grown accustomed to. So, for now, the search for the perfect solution continues.

By the way, I’m currently enjoying the atmosphere of a cozy café in Moshi. It's always great to tackle tech challenges with a good cup of coffee in hand!
