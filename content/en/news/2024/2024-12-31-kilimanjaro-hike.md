Today is the last day of 2024, and it feels surreal to think how distant 2025 once seemed. Now, it’s right around the corner. In March 2025, I’ll celebrate eight years of traveling, and it’s incredible how quickly time has flown. While I haven’t visited every country on my list, I’ve had the chance to explore so many breathtaking places.  

This morning, I decided on a spontaneous hike in the Kilimanjaro region. My plan was to walk towards the Materuni Waterfall, but I never made it there. Instead, I found myself savoring the journey through the countryside, soaking in the beauty of the landscape around me.  

It was a peaceful and fulfilling way to spend the final day of the year. However, I didn’t bring a hat or water, so I returned to the hostel before noon. Now, I plan to relax for the rest of the day.  

Tomorrow, I’ll write a blog post about the hike and share all the photos with you. Stay tuned for more details!  

**Wishing you a wonderful start to the new year 2025!**
