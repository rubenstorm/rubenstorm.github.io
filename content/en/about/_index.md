**Exploring the World** - *One Milestone at a Time*

## Minimalist & Nomad

A wanderer and minimalist who finds joy in the simple and beautiful aspects of life. Since March 2017, I’ve been traveling part-time, but in February 2018, I took the leap to full-time travel. My journey began with bus, train, carpool, ferry, and foot adventures through my ancestral homeland, expanding to explore Europe and eventually, the world.

## About Me

My family arrived in Germany as refugees before I was born, adjusting well and embracing the opportunities presented to them. They were able to build a house as part of a refugee project, and I was born just as this house was completed and the garden was growing. My childhood was spent in a peaceful, quiet community on the outskirts of a small town near Stuttgart.

In 2017, I began part-time traveling, and by 2018, I found myself fully immersed in a nomadic lifestyle—a path I hadn’t originally planned, but one that unfolded step by step. By 2020, an unexpected accident led me to adopt minimalism; I could no longer manage my large backpack, which inadvertently shifted my approach to living. I’ll share more about my journey into nomadism and minimalism in an upcoming update.

After returning to Germany from my initial travels, a journalist featured my story in articles published by “Heilbronner Stimme” and “Mitteilungsblatt der Bessarabiendeutschen.”


### What the Press wrote about me
> »The 45-year-old Ruben Storm chose a different approach to his family history: In March of this year he traveled with a backpack from Stuttgart by bus, hitchhike and on foot to Ukraine. “My goal was to sit and have lunch on my grandparents property in Hoffnungstal”, he said with a mischievous grin.«
