## ColMaTro

ColMaTro, short for 'Colorful Matic Troll,' is a vibrant NFT collection on the Polygon Network. Scroll down to explore more about this unique collection or discover how you can become an owner.

## Polygon NFT

The **Polygon Network** is a Layer 2 solution for Ethereum that offers faster transactions and lower fees while benefiting from Ethereum’s security. It improves the user experience for dApps, DeFi, and NFTs by using Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus and sidechains.

**Polygon NFTs** are similar to Ethereum NFTs but with lower fees, faster transactions, and better environmental efficiency. They’re interoperable with Ethereum, allowing seamless movement of assets between the two networks, making Polygon a popular choice for NFT creators and collectors.

## The Story Behind
**Launched in March 2023**

Originally, I planned to create album covers to sell on Fiverr, but things took a different turn. Instead, I ended up designing a series of colorful trolls. What began as a failed attempt at an album cover turned into a captivating new NFT collection. Enthralled by the troll design, I decided to bring it to life on Opensea. Within a week, the collection was born, and perhaps you’ll find a troll you’d like to call your own.

### Location

This collection exists purely in the realm of imagination.

### Minted

Available on Opensea, each item in this collection is minted 5 times on the Polygon Chain.

### Vision

The inspiration for this collection came from a day when my creative energies were focused on making trolls rather than completing my original task. The joy I found in creating these trolls far surpassed my initial intentions.
