## Crypto Panda

I crafted a distinctive piece of AI art that features a panda alongside cryptocurrency, which I subsequently converted into an NFT (non-fungible token). My inspiration came from the pressing need for panda conservation, considering their endangered status and the special significance they hold for me. Rather than selecting a generic bear, I specifically chose a panda to highlight their critical plight.

## WAX Blockchain

WAX (Worldwide Asset eXchange) is a blockchain platform designed for creating, buying, selling, and trading NFTs (non-fungible tokens). It features fast transactions, low fees, and user-friendly tools tailored for digital collectibles. With a dedicated marketplace and support for diverse categories like digital art and gaming assets, WAX fosters a vibrant community and collaborates with various brands and games, positioning itself as a significant player in the NFT space.

## The Story Behind
**Launched in 2023**

In addition to my deep affection for pandas, a friend of mine works with them in China, which adds a personal touch to this project. We've often joked about his work with pandas, and this connection further inspired me to use this opportunity to advocate for their protection on a global scale.

By converting this AI art into an NFT and sharing it worldwide, I aim to raise awareness about the precarious status of pandas and encourage collective efforts for their preservation. This symbolic gesture is a call to action, urging everyone to unite in safeguarding these beloved creatures and ensuring their future.

### Location

This creation exists exclusively in the digital realm, crafted on my laptop while I was in Kilifi. It has no physical counterpart, reflecting my creative efforts during my time there.

### Minted

This collection is available on the WAX Blockchain, with each item minted 1000 times.

### Vision

My goal in converting this AI art into an NFT and distributing it globally is to highlight the endangered status of pandas and inspire actions that will help secure their survival. This digital art piece serves as a beacon for awareness and conservation.
