## Mati Trolls

Trolls are massive, terrifying creatures with magical powers, rooted in early Scandinavian folklore. They were said to dwell in castles, terrorizing the nearby countryside after dark. These hostile beings turned to stone or exploded when exposed to sunlight.


## Polygon Network

The **Polygon Network** is a Layer 2 solution for Ethereum that offers faster transactions and lower fees while benefiting from Ethereum’s security. It improves the user experience for dApps, DeFi, and NFTs by using Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus and sidechains.

**Polygon NFTs** are similar to Ethereum NFTs but with lower fees, faster transactions, and better environmental efficiency. They’re interoperable with Ethereum, allowing seamless movement of assets between the two networks, making Polygon a popular choice for NFT creators and collectors.

## The Story Behind
**Launched in 2022**​

The Mati Trolls NFT collection was born by accident. While staying at a hostel in Tanzania, I found myself bored and decided to experiment with AI on my laptop. It was one of my earliest experiences with AI, and what emerged was completely unexpected. The trolls took shape, gained a name, and came to life as a unique NFT collection. No new items will be added to this collection—this was a one-time creation, and I hope you enjoy it. I look forward to seeing you as the proud owner of one of these NFTs.

### Location

Created during a dull day in Tanzania, this collection came to life through a spontaneous experiment with AI.

### Minted

The collection is available on Opensea, minted on the Polygon chain. Each piece in the collection has been minted 10 times.

### Vision

As my first foray into AI, this project was designed to offer unusual, mystical images with a unique twist.
