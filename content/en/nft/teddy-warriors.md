## Teddy Warriors

Initially, the concept was to craft a simple bear, but it swiftly transformed into something unexpected. Somehow, these teddy bears became armed, mirroring the complexities of our modern world—where they first show affection and then, unexpectedly, turn to weapons. I believed the most effective way to convey this was by illustrating a teddy bear holding a rifle.

## Polygon NFT Collection

The Polygon NFT Collection consists of non-fungible tokens built on the Polygon network, a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It offers faster and cheaper transactions, making it attractive for creators and collectors. The collection features diverse digital art and assets, and NFTs can interact across different blockchains. Polygon's proof-of-stake model reduces environmental impact compared to traditional Ethereum NFTs. With support from popular marketplaces like OpenSea and a vibrant community, Polygon is a key player in the NFT space.


## The Story Behind
**Launched in 2022**

This NFT collection was born out of a spontaneous moment while tinkering on my laptop. I was reminded of a Teddy bear my mother gave me as a child—a big, cuddly companion that I cherished for years. I also recalled my Gorilla Teddy with its lifelike face and a little Hedgehog I received when I was about 5 or 6 years old and unwell. Somehow, this NFT took on a warrior's persona. I hope you'll enjoy owning this unique creation.

### Location

One day in Tanzania, I found myself in a hostel, surrounded by its eclectic interior decor. The ambiance transported me back to my childhood, stirring up memories from that time, even though I never spent my childhood in Tanzania. The hostel's atmosphere had an uncanny way of bringing those distant memories to life.

### Minted

This collection is available on Opensea, with each item minted 10 times on the Polygon Chain.

### Vision

Inspired by the hostel's decor, I experimented with my laptop and AI, and gradually, this collection took shape.
