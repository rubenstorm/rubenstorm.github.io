## The Story Behind

After more than six years of traveling and exploring over 35 countries, I’m inspired to transform my adventures into a distinctive digital collection. I’ve curated a series of NFTs, each featuring a striking photograph from my global travels. These NFTs act as collectible mementos of the incredible places I’ve visited, with each image clearly indicating its location, enabling collectors to connect with the essence of those captured moments.

## Wax Network

WAX (Worldwide Asset eXchange) is a blockchain specifically designed for trading virtual assets, particularly in gaming and digital collectibles. It employs a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, ensuring fast and cost-effective transactions. WAX offers a user-friendly platform with a dedicated marketplace for buying, selling, and trading virtual items. Many games integrate WAX to allow players to monetize in-game assets. Additionally, WAX is energy-efficient and provides developers with tools to create and manage digital assets, fostering a robust ecosystem for NFTs and virtual goods.

## From Wanderlust to Collection

**Launched in 2022**

This collection, aptly named TPC or "Travel Photo Collection," is a testament to my passion for both travel and photography.

I invite you to explore this collection and experience the beauty and diversity of our world through my lens. Your support is invaluable, and as a token of my gratitude, I’ll occasionally share exclusive offers and complimentary drops with my followers on platforms like Twitter (X) and Nostr. Stay tuned as we embark on this digital journey together, one pixelated adventure at a time.

### Location

The places I’ve traveled to—and will travel to—are represented in this NFT card collection.

### Minted

This collection is available on the Wax Blockchain, with each item in the collection minted 2,000 times.

### Vision

Reflecting on my photos after more than six years of travel inspired me to create an NFT collection. My goal is to share it with those who appreciate it while also generating some financial support. Feel free to explore the blockchain; it’s all public, showing how much it might yield for me.
