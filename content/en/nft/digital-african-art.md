## Digital African Art

I’ve transformed the breathtaking art I discovered in Africa into a digital format. When you visit Tanzania, you’ll encounter art that is incredibly inspiring. It made such a profound impression on me that I developed this NFT series inspired by those experiences. Keep scrolling to learn more and think about adding one of these unique NFTs to your collection!

## Polygon NFT

The **Polygon Network** is a Layer 2 solution for Ethereum that provides faster transactions and reduced fees while leveraging Ethereum’s robust security. It enhances the user experience for dApps, DeFi, and NFTs through its use of Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus and sidechains.

**Polygon NFTs** function similarly to Ethereum NFTs but come with lower fees, quicker transactions, and improved environmental efficiency. They are fully interoperable with Ethereum, enabling effortless asset transfers between the two networks, which makes Polygon a favored option for NFT creators and collectors alike.

## The Story Behind
**Launched in 2022**

My journey through Tanzania, with its vibrant art and culture, sparked the creation of this NFT series. From the art museums to hostel decor and street scenes, Tanzania’s artistic spirit deeply influenced me. This was one of my first NFT projects, inspired by the hostel and town where I was staying. I still cherish those moments and hope you’ll enjoy owning a piece of that inspiration.

### Location

Inspired by my travels in Tanzania, including the hostel I stayed at and the breathtaking surroundings of Kilimanjaro. The ambiance around Kilimanjaro played a major role in shaping this collection.

### Minted

This collection is available on Opensea, minted 100 times per item on the Polygon Chain.

### Vision

The incredible art and craftsmanship I experienced in Tanzania made me realize the need to digitize and share it. For a dose of inspiration, visit the base of Kilimanjaro and absorb the surroundings.
