I've been to Egypt three times. The first time, I arrived at Hurghada Airport in the middle of the night and traveled by bus across the country to explore the main sites, eventually flying out from Sharm El Sheikh. On my second visit, I flew directly into Sharm El Sheikh and spent most of my time relaxing on the beaches in Dahab. Afterward, I crossed the border on foot from Taba to Eilat. A few days later, I re-entered Egypt through the same crossing, hoping to get a visa to travel to Luxor and fly out from there. However, they only issued me a stamp that allowed a two-week stay in Sinai.

At the Taba border, the officer sold me the visa for $25 but then demanded an additional $100 to validate it. Unwilling to pay, I decided to stay in Dahab for another two weeks and eventually walked back over the Taba-Eilat border. Because I didn't pay the extra amount, they only granted me a 14-day stay in Sinai. That third visit was my last time in Egypt. It felt like they weren’t too welcoming to tourists, so I shifted my plans and enjoyed the rest of my trip in Israel and Jordan instead.
