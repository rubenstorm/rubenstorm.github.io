Every bit is appreciated!\n🧠 About Binance Smart Chain (BSC): Past, Present \u0026amp; Future 🚀 A Brief History Launched by Binance in September 2020, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) was designed as a high-performance, low-cost alternative to Ethereum. While Ethereum pioneered smart contracts, its rising gas fees created accessibility issues. BSC introduced the BEP20 token standard and a dual-chain architecture that allows users to move assets between Binance Chain and BSC.\nFrom the beginning, BSC prioritized speed, efficiency, and developer-friendliness, making it the go-to chain for DeFi, NFTs, and high-frequency transactions. Within its first year, BSC exploded in popularity, hosting thousands of dApps and surpassing Ethereum in daily transaction count.\n🌐 BSC Today Today, BSC is one of the most active blockchains in the world. With ultra-low fees, fast block times (~3 seconds), and broad token support (including BNB, USDT, USDC, DAI, SFP, and more), BSC continues to thrive in both the DeFi and Web3 space.\nIts ecosystem powers:\nWallets like Trust Wallet and SafePal Platforms like PancakeSwap, Venus, and MetaMask (via BSC integration) NFT marketplaces, launchpads, and DAOs Millions of retail and developer wallets globally 🌱 The Future of BSC The roadmap ahead for BSC includes:\nScalability improvements via sidechains and rollups Interoperability with other major blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos) Growing ecosystem incentives to support developers and community projects Greater decentralization and validator expansion through BNB Chain evolution With continued innovation and community adoption, BSC aims to stay at the heart of Web3 — powering everything from micro-donations to entire financial systems.\n⚡ Enter StormQR: A Simple Way to Accept BSC Donations As part of the BSC ecosystem, I created StormQR, a modern Hugo shortcode that lets creators, developers, and bloggers accept crypto donations in a clean, branded, and user-friendly way.\nWhy StormQR? ✅ Fast QR code generation 💱 Supports any BEP20 token (BNB, USDT, USDC, DAI, SFP, BUSD, etc.) 🎨 Custom branding with icon overlays and wallet labels ⚡ Optional Lightning effect for ⚡️Lightning addresses 📱 Mobile-friendly design with Trust Wallet CDN icons 🧩 Installable as a Hugo module — plug \u0026amp; play!

Originally, Alby was a free custodial wallet, but its transition to Alby Hub has introduced changes. Alby Hub is only free if you host it on your own server, which involves additional expenses and a degree of technical expertise. Essentially, using Alby Hub now involves either financial or technical investment.\nI initially relied on GetAlby for handling sats on Nostr, a decentralized, censorship-resistant social media protocol. Whenever my GetAlby wallet balance exceeded 10k or 20k sats, I transferred the funds to my Phoenix or Zeus wallet. Both of these are non-custodial wallets, ensuring full control of my Bitcoins — \u0026ldquo;not your keys, not your coins.\u0026rdquo;\nTo address my issues, I researched alternative solutions and found Minibits, which I connected using NWC (Nostr Wallet Connect). Minibits, though still in experimental, offers a clean design and reliable performance. Thanks to the Minibits team for a great project! Initially, I also considered Coinos, but registration problems prevented me from proceeding. However, after raising the issue on Nostr, Coinos promptly resolved it, and I successfully registered. I plan to explore Coinos further in the future. These projects provide excellent support; posting questions or issues on Nostr often results in quick assistance.\nMinibits has proven to be an impressive app with intuitive functionality. NWC works seamlessly with Amethyst and Primal. While I’ve started using Primal as my main client, I’ve experienced errors when posting photos. This issue might be related to my unstable internet connection, but I will keep an eye on it.\nRegarding browser extensions, I plan to stick with GetAlby for as long as it continues to function. If necessary, I’ll transition to new solutions as they develop.\nA Big Thank You to the Nostr Community I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the entire Nostr community for their incredible support and informations. The guidance I received helped me find solutions to challenges I faced and explore new tools and approaches. Your quick responses to questions, innovative ideas, and commitment to building a decentralized, censorship-resistant ecosystem are truly inspiring.\nFrom addressing technical issues to sharing recommendations, the Nostr community has shown what’s possible when people collaborate and support one another.

The day began like most others on the road: shower, breakfast and a cup of coffee. While I was at the hostel’s breakfast area, a man from Switzerland approached me with an invitation. He and two others planned to hike to the waterfalls — a journey I had taken before. The idea was tempting, but I wasn’t keen on paying the 10,000 TZS entrance fee and guide charge of another 10,000 TZS again.\nAfter politely declining, I told them I would walk part of the path with them before heading to a spot for coffee. We hopped into a TukTuk bound for Rau, a small area on the town\u0026rsquo;s border. Upon arrival, I checked the coffee spot only to find it locked and noone there. Adjusting my plan, I decided to accompany them further along the trail toward Materuni, at least to the point where the road steeply ascends.\nThe walk was hot and challenging. The morning sun bore down relentlessly, and I had neither a hat nor water with me. Halfway along the path, feeling unwell, I wished my companions a good hike and turned back. I realized I’d taken only a couple of photos, so I decided to slow down and immerse myself in the beauty of my surroundings.\nStrolling Through Nature The walk back turned into a serene, unplanned exploration. I wandered among lush banana trees and rustic roads lined with modest houses. Children played joyfully, elders sat roadside selling fruits and vegetables, and motorbikes and trucks rumbled past, transporting goods to the market. The simplicity of life around me was humbling and beautiful.\nThe view opened to reveal rolling hills and dense jungle. The scenery was breathtaking — a vibrant tapestry of farming lands, winding paths, and distant greenery. I paused frequently to soak it all in, taking photos and relishing the quiet moments of solitude.\nEncounters on the Road As I reached an intersection with a cluster of houses, I was met with shouts from locals offering rides — on taxis or bodas (motorcycle taxis). Politely declining, I continued my walk. A memorable encounter occurred when a boy, no older than 10, arrived on a motorcycle with his older brother seated behind him. The boy barely reached the pedals, and his brother had to stabilize the bike when it stopped. They tried to convince me to hop on for a ride, but I declined and watched them speed off, the boy driving like a seasoned pro.\nReturning to Town The rest of the walk was peaceful and uneventful. I crossed a river, climbed a hill, and finally entered Moshi. I stopped again at the coffee spot, but it was still locked. Near the main road, where TukTuks gathered, drivers eagerly offered me tours or rides at inflated prices. I opted for a quick, cheap ride back to the hostel for just 700 TZS.\nDehydrated and with a pounding headache, I spent the afternoon resting. Later, I ventured out for dinner: fries with beef shashlik for 4,000 TZS. However, the experience was far from appetizing. The vendor reused dirty plates, wiping them down with an old rag before serving food. It was a stark reminder of the challenges that come with nomadic living.\nRinging in the New Year As midnight approached, I joined others outside the hostel to watch the fireworks over Kibo Palace. While the display couldn’t compare to the dazzling New Year’s Eve I once experienced in Odessa, it was a fitting end to another year of exploration. Memories of past celebrations in places like Mardin, Antalya, and Mombasa flooded my mind, but Odessa remains my favorite.\nEnjoy these snapshots from my last day of 2024.

While it promises a partial solution to the issues I’ve been facing with the Alby Custodial Wallet, it’s still not perfect. There are features I’d like to see that are missing, and uploading images — like the ones I’m working on now in a café at the foot of Kilimanjaro — remains a challenge. Primal’s Prime Account is an option, but it doesn’t align with my current needs. If I could generate enough income over nostr to cover itself, I’d consider it, but for now, my search for a solution continues.\nThis morning, I decided to try a new café, someone recommended to me recently. The ambiance is lovely, and it has a great vibe, though a bit on the pricey side. The cappuccino was delightful, and its proximity to my hostel makes it a convenient spot. I might return, but I’m also intrigued by another recommendation: Aroma Coffee. The name reminds me of Aroma Kava in Ukraine, which I loved. I’ll have to visit it soon and see how it compares.\nFor today, my plans are simple. I aim to download videos from one cloud storage and transfer them to WeVideo for editing. My video projects have been on my mind, and I’m eager to keep making progress. Additionally, I’m experimenting with setting up VS Code for LaTeX. Currently, I’m drafting this blog post in VS Code using Markdown, but I’ve been inspired to explore LaTeX after reading an article about it. It’s been a while since I used Kile for LaTeX editing, so this will be a relearning experience. My goal is to make VS Code as versatile as possible for my creative and technical needs.\nLooking ahead, I’m starting to think about my travel plans for 2025. At the beginning of the year, I’d like to explore new cities, perhaps visit Victoria Falls in Zambia, or even check out Uganda and the Nile’s source. However, I know I’ll eventually loop back to East Africa, with plans to end up in Mombasa. A flight to Germany crossed my mind, but my budget is too tight for that at the moment. Hopefully, in the next couple of days, I’ll have more clarity about my next steps. For now, I need to extend my stay at the hostel, pay my rent, and finalize my plans.\nMoshi has been a delightful place to stay. It’s undeniably more picturesque than Kilifi, though each has its charm. While Kilifi boasts beaches, Moshi offers the majestic Kilimanjaro and a plethora of beautiful cafés and restaurants. The streets here are livelier, with newer cars and more spots to relax and soak in the atmosphere.\nUnfortunately, I’m temporarily barred from entering Kenya. The border officer informed me that my frequent entries and exits have triggered restrictions. After some time, this should reset, and I’ll be able to return to explore the places I’ve missed.\nSpeaking of Kenya, I have to mention a surprising development from my time in Kilifi — my psoriasis disappeared. I attribute this to the consistent warm climate, the salty ocean air, and year-round sunshine. I’m optimistic that staying in a warm environment for the next couple of years will keep it away permanently.\nBefore leaving Moshi, I plan to buy a multipurpose sheet that I can use as a wrap or towel. It fits perfectly with my minimalist lifestyle. I’ve also been contemplating replacing my worn-out T-shirts with something new. While they’re still functional, they’ve seen better days.\nI’ll wrap up this post here and wish everyone a beautiful Sunday. Stay tuned for more updates and photos from my day — including snapshots of the café and my walk there.

There are features I’d like to see that are missing, and uploading images — like the ones I’m working on now in a café at the foot of Kilimanjaro — remains a challenge. Primal’s Prime Account is an option, but it doesn’t align with my current needs. If I could generate enough income over nostr to cover itself, I’d consider it, but for now, my search for a solution continues.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Exploring Moshi"},{"content":"Navigating the Changes in Nostr: Zaps, Sats, and the End of Alby’s Custodial Wallet\nToday, I want to dive into a technical issue that’s been on my mind lately. If you’re familiar with Nostr, you’ll know it’s a decentralized protocol somewhat akin to X (formerly Twitter). Unlike X, though, Nostr isn’t a platform — it’s a protocol, which means it’s open and flexible, with various clients to use.\nIn Nostr, you can receive both likes and zaps (which are small amounts of Bitcoin sent using the Lightning Network). You’ll find a wide range of features on Nostr, such as long-form content via NIP-23 or Pinstr, a tool for sharing photos. But today, I want to focus on zaps: sending and receiving Sats (short for Satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin).\nFor my transactions, I’ve been using Alby, a custodial Lightning wallet. The zaps are processed through the Lightning Network, and I’ve relied on Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC) to link my wallet to my Nostr account. It’s been a simple and efficient system — until now.\nThe Problem Alby recently announced they’re discontinuing their custodial wallet service. They’re transitioning to the Alby Hub, a non-custodial system that requires users to essentially run their own Lightning node. While this move aligns with the principles of decentralization, it comes with additional costs: roughly $12/month for hosting the node.\nFor someone like me, who doesn’t generate significant income from zaps on Nostr, this expense is hard to justify. I suspect many others are in the same boat, grappling with how to adapt to this change.\nSeeking a Solution At the moment, I’m still searching for a viable alternative. The simplicity and accessibility of Alby’s custodial wallet made it a great solution for users like me, who aren’t earning much through Nostr. It’s disappointing to see it go, though I understand the financial challenges of maintaining such a service.\nFor now, I’m reaching out to the community. Are there other Nostr users out there who have found effective solutions to this issue? Perhaps you’ve discovered a cost-effective way to manage your Lightning wallet or a workaround that doesn’t require running your own node. If so, I’d love to hear your insights.\nFinal Thoughts While I’m saddened by the end of Alby’s custodial wallet, I remain hopeful that the Nostr community’s ingenuity will lead to new, user-friendly solutions. In the meantime, I’ll continue exploring my options and sharing what I learn along the way.\nIf you have any suggestions or experiences to share, tweet the link to this post on X (formerly Twitter) or post it on Nostr.

That morning, I took an early bus, crossing the Taveta border, winding through a national park, and passing towns and wild landscapes.\nThe journey was mesmerizing. I love the rhythm of these long bus rides across Africa, where the wild beauty of nature alternates with bustling towns. The wild, however, always steals my heart—lush greenery, open skies, and the occasional sight of wildlife.\nWhen the bus reached Mariakani, I hopped off and boarded a matatu—Kenya’s ubiquitous shared minibuses, crammed with passengers like sardines in a can. Though I’m not a fan of the overcrowding, it’s part of the African travel experience and culture.\nThe matatu took me to Kilifi, where I planned to use as a base for exploring Mombasa, Malindi, and Watamu. Yet, life had other plans. I spent the next few months solely in Kilifi, settling into routines. More on that in my next post, along with some photos.\nBack to Moshi Two days ago, I retraced my steps, leaving Kilifi at 6 a.m. in a matatu. I switched to another in Mombasa, heading toward Taveta. This leg of the trip crossed through the national park again, offering breathtaking scenery. At Taveta, I hired a boda-boda (motorbike taxi) to cross the border into Holili, Tanzania, before catching a dala-dala (Tanzania’s version of the matatu) to Moshi.\nThe entire trip cost me 1,900 KES (Kenyan Shillings), broken down as follows:\nKilifi to Taveta: 1,500 KES Boda-boda from Taveta to Holili: 300 KES Dala-dala from Holili to Moshi: 2,000 TZS (around 100 KES). By 5 p.m., I was back in Moshi. Walking into the same hostel I stayed at three months earlier, I asked for a bed. To my surprise, the receptionist said my old bed was free, making it feel like I’d never left.\nA Border Encounter Crossing borders in Africa is never dull. This time, the Kenyan officer flagged my frequent entries into Kenya over the past two years. He wasn’t happy, calling it \u0026ldquo;illegal\u0026rdquo; and grilling me with questions before stamping me out.\nOn the Tanzanian side, things were smoother—until the Kenyan officer crossed over and spoke to the Tanzanian border police. Suddenly, they had questions about my travel plans: where I was going, how long I’d stay, and what I’d do. Eventually, they validated my visa, and I was free to continue my journey.\nMy boda-boda driver, true to his word, waited for me and dropped me at the bus station in Holili, where the dala-dala was ready. For travelers, there’s also a small exchange booth here if you need to swap currencies.\nLessons in African Travel One pro tip: book your tickets yourself. I learned this when my Moshi-to-Mombasa ticket cost me 35,000 TZS this time, 5,000 TZS cheaper than six months ago. Why? I went directly to the sales office. In Africa, it’s common for “helpful” locals to show you where to buy tickets, but they often arrange for you to be overcharged, pocketing the extra as their cut.\nFrom wild landscapes to bustling markets, these journeys always offer a mix of beauty, adventure, and life lessons. Next up: my time in Kilifi and the routines that made it feel like home.

I worked for a year at the company where I had trained, but this time was marked by bullying. However, the money I earned allowed me to take my first major trip — initially meant to be my only one before I returned, worked, built a house, found a girlfriend, and started a family. But life doesn\u0026rsquo;t always follow our plans. “Nothing is as constant as change.”\nMy journey took me across the USA for about a year. I flew from Frankfurt to Atlanta and then to Fayetteville, where I bought a Ford Escort and made a few modifications. I then drove from Lumberton, NC, heading south to Florida and onward to the West Coast. I lived in that car for several months: the trunk was my kitchen and closet, the driver’s seat was my bed, and the backseat was my storage, where I kept my bedroom during the day. I even had a clothesline over the rear deck to dry my clothes. It wasn’t ideal, but I miss those times.\nIn my black Ford Escort, with tinted windows and a red stripe, I drove from coast to coast. I visited places like New Orleans, Houston, and Phoenix, hiked in the Grand Canyon, and drove through Death Valley to San Francisco. I then followed Highway 101 north until I ended up in a small town called West Linn, Oregon, just south of Portland. This area became my home, and I went on many hikes in the Gorge.\nWhen my time in the USA came to an end, I took my Escort and drove back to the East Coast. My return flight was from Fayetteville, but I was on the other side of the continent. The drive back took me through Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, then through Atlanta to Lumberton. There, I sold my car and flew back to Frankfurt.\nUpon returning to Germany, I found myself in serious trouble with the state. I was arrested, and without access to a lawyer, I was tortured and beaten. During interrogations, I was repeatedly asked the same questions: why I had returned to Germany, what my purpose here was, and who I was working for. Despite my constant insistence that I knew nothing, no one believed me.\nThis ordeal lasted for some time. I was locked naked in a freezing cold room, tiled entirely in white. The situation changed when a table and two chairs were brought into the room. A man entered, and he was different. He spoke to me calmly and kindly — there were no more beatings, no electric shocks, and no more threatening psychopaths. Just him and me, having a normal conversation.\nAfter a while, he stood up and left the room. Shortly after, I heard someone outside say to close the door. The man simply responded that I was innocent and truly knew nothing about what was going on. Suddenly, my clothes were thrown into the room, and I was told to get dressed and come out.\nWhen I did, they forced me to sign a document. I wasn’t allowed to read it. I was only told that it said I had been treated well. They warned me that if I claimed otherwise, I would disappear without a trace. Shortly after, I was released. But instead of going home, I was taken to the Bundeswehr, where I served for a period.\nAt first, my time in the Bundeswehr was tough, and I was accused of many things. But later, everything was cleared up, and I experienced a world that both disappointed and fascinated me. I spent some time in Calw and left the Bundeswehr a few years later as a SFC.\nDuring my time in the Bundeswehr, I founded an IT company that did quite well. But nothing lasts forever, and people change. I became seriously ill and fell into a coma. After recovering, I had to relearn everything — from walking to reading and writing.\nAt the Hohenurach Clinic, I was declared incapacitated, and my life fell apart. Later, I was made a slave and endured a world I never thought possible in Germany. I was accused, interrogated by the police, and a man from a Federal Office (BfV) told me to keep quiet — Germany had enough scandals and didn’t need another one.\nBut that’s another story.\n","permalink":"https://rubenstorm.github.io/en/about/my-previous-life/adulthood/","summary":"Ruben Storm completed his industrial mechanic training and used his earnings to fund a year-long road trip across the USA, living out of a modified car.

But my school experience painted a different picture. On the way home, I was regularly attacked by a group of older students, usually three to five boys from my class. These boys had repeated a few grades and made it their mission to bully me during breaks or on my way home. They would corner me, beat me up, or throw me into thorn bushes. This cycle of abuse lasted until my final year of school, when the case finally went to court, and the bullies were convicted. Although their sentences were ridiculously light, I felt some relief and a sense of justice.\nThese difficult years taught me resilience and the ability to face fear. That lesson proved valuable when I became a soldier, making me someone who could not easily be brought down.\nAfter the trial, my life settled down, and I started studying to become an industrial mechanic. However, discrimination continued to shadow me, and I often felt like an outsider. I believed my background was the cause, and embracing my heritage felt impossible at times. I longed to be just a regular kid. Around the age of 14, when my grandmother could no longer live on her own and moved in with my aunt, I began to distance myself from my roots.\nDespite my struggles, I made it through school, although I often felt unchallenged. The lessons bored me, and I frequently dozed off during class. I rarely did my homework, which occasionally got me into trouble.\nI sat next to a boy who was older and also found school challenging. One day, he noticed that I got good grades despite paying little attention and asked if he could copy my tests. In return, he offered to do my homework. At first, I was hesitant, worried the teachers would notice, but he assured me he’d change the answers enough to avoid suspicion. So, we struck a deal: I’d copy his homework before class, and he’d copy my test answers.\nThis system worked seamlessly for years, until one day in my final year, I was accused of copying another student who sat far from me. The teachers were skeptical, and I had no explanation for the similarities. I later found out that the boy copying from me had started sharing my answers with the entire class. Most of them changed their responses slightly, but one student’s answers were too close to mine.\nI was furious, especially since even the boys who had bullied me were now indirectly benefiting from my work. Yet, part of me found it ironic.\nWhen final exams came around, that chapter of my life closed. In trade school, I had to do all my homework myself, and no one was copying from me anymore. Despite this, I made it through both school and my training without much trouble. I had a habit of studying hard at the last minute, and somehow, it worked. I ended up with good grades, much to my mother’s amazement. She could never understand how I managed to do it, and honestly, I still don’t have a clear explanation — it just seemed to work.\n","permalink":"https://rubenstorm.github.io/en/about/my-previous-life/my-youth/","summary":"In my youth, I was bullied by older boys until they were convicted in my final school year, which taught me resilience that later helped me during my military service.

She lived in a house on the outskirts of the city, with a beautiful view down into the valley and the river. Every morning, before I went to school, my mother would tell me whether I should come home for lunch or go to my grandmother\u0026rsquo;s. If I was supposed to go to her, I would get off the school bus three stops early. Often, I’d see my grandmother working in the garden as the bus passed her property. Sometimes, I’d walk directly from school to her house, saving myself the long wait for the bus. This way, I was often already inside the house when the bus drove by.\nThe days spent with my grandmother were filled with fascinating stories. She would tell me about her homeland, life on the steppe, and her childhood. She often spoke of her father, who had fallen in World War I fighting for the Tsarist Empire, and of the time when the Nazis came east, and they had to leave their home. She showed me cherished items she had saved and spoke of all the things that were lost. To me, these stories were more exciting than any movie. As a young boy, I could picture myself in the vast Eurasian steppe.\nI would ask her endless questions about her homeland — what it looked like, how people lived, and why they had come to Germany. I was especially curious about why she had left such a beautiful place. Her response was always the same: \u0026ldquo;Siberia is the freezer of the world, and we weren’t allowed to stay.\u0026rdquo;\nDespite that, I kept asking more questions. \u0026ldquo;What does this word mean, Grandma?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;What does it look like there?\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;How is the weather in the steppe?\u0026rdquo; Even though I might have been bothering her, she never showed it. She patiently answered every question and turned it into a game to keep me engaged.\nMy grandmother was self-sufficient. She made almost everything herself — fruits, vegetables, schnapps, even soap. She sewed her own clothes, made bedding and cushions, and embroidered tablecloths with designs from her homeland. She even repaired her own shoes. She chopped wood and handled all the work around the house and garden herself, as my grandfather had passed away before I was born. I often helped, learning from a young age how to use tools like a hoe or an ax.\nThe house itself was simple, and each room had its own unique way of being heated. When my grandmother woke me up in the mornings, it was often bitterly cold, but she had already warmed my clothes on the oven. She got up every day at 6 a.m. to light the fire and heat water so I could wash with warm water.\nSometimes, my mother would pick me up after coming home from university, but occasionally I was allowed to spend the night at my grandmother\u0026rsquo;s. I loved her homemade down blankets, which were so thick you couldn’t see over them. However, I wasn’t too fond of the straw mattresses, which were always a bit too hard for my liking.\nMy grandmother lived close to the cemetery, and she went there almost daily to tend to my grandfather\u0026rsquo;s grave. Whenever I stayed with her, I had to go along. The path there was challenging, as there was no direct route, and you had to walk around and then climb a steep hill. I remember clearly the day my grandmother stopped going to the cemetery after my grandfather’s grave was leveled. She tried to explain it to me as a child, but I didn’t fully understand at the time.\nThose were formative years, filled with learning — about life, another culture, and foods that weren’t common in Germany. Even the sweets my grandmother made were homemade. While other children played outside, I was in the garden or enjoying homemade treats. I didn’t have many friends, but I did have a few with whom I spent some time.\n","permalink":"https://rubenstorm.github.io/en/about/my-previous-life/my-childhood/","summary":"As a child, Ruben spent much of his time with his grandmother while his mother was studying.

They quickly settled in and took advantage of the opportunities their new home offered. In a housing project for refugees, they were given the chance to build a house. The timing was perfect—just as the house was finished and the garden was being planted, I came into the world. Our home was in a small settlement on the outskirts of a village near Stuttgart, and I had my own soft fur blanket that I often lay on as a baby. For some reason, most of my baby photos were taken on that fur.\nMy mother once told me that she had known since she was seven years old that her first son would be named Ruben. Eventually, I became that Ruben—the first son after a series of sisters. I quickly became the family favorite, the second grandson to my grandparents, and the only son to my parents. At family gatherings or large reunions, I was often showered with affection by grandmothers — I barely knew what was happening to me. One of my most vivid memories is of a homeland gathering in the Schleierhalle, where all the older women gave me sweets and smothered me with hugs. I loved these gatherings because there were always treats, and the grandmothers were incredibly kind.\nWhen I think about the language that was spoken back then, I immediately feel at home. Sadly, that language has now disappeared — the last generation who spoke it has passed on, and today it lives on in no one.

It felt like an invisible weight was pressing down on me, and the idea that such things could happen in 21st-century Germany left me traumatized. Suddenly, I had nothing and had to rebuild everything from scratch, even the simplest items like spoons and forks. The very thought of it was agonizing, and I didn’t want to continue down that path. Everything with sentimental value – gifts from beloved family members who had passed away – was gone forever.\nMoney can be replaced, but memories captured in photos and keepsakes from those who are no longer with us are irreplaceable. The objects that hold emotional value cannot simply be renewed. Sure, you can buy something similar, but it will never carry the same meaning. It’s like a historical building: once destroyed and rebuilt, it never holds the same spirit. This realization weighed heavily on me and pushed me to the edge of despair. With a loan, I began my journey into nomadic life. I bought an 85-liter backpack and a small daypack, filling them with clothes and personal items, and set off.\nBut the unrest didn’t leave me. Buying new things brought me no joy, and the thought of settling down didn’t fulfill me either. The trauma of my recent past and the events in the country I once called home loomed over me like a shadow. It felt as if something was tearing me apart inside, preventing me from finding peace.\nIn the summer of 2019, I injured my left foot in Ukraine and quickly realized that my two backpacks were far too big and heavy for me. Their weight worsened my injury and hindered my recovery. The pain increased every time I moved.\nI continued traveling through Russia, Scandinavia, Germany, France, Slovenia, and Croatia. Eventually, I found myself in Sarajevo, staring at my backpacks and realizing I needed to lighten my load. It was time for a drastic change. I needed a smaller backpack and fewer belongings.\nAs I began to downsize, I realized there was barely anything left from my previous life. Almost everything I had was acquired after my stay in the asylum in Korb, and nothing held significant value. It was easy to part with most things since they carried no emotional weight. I downsized from an 85-liter and a 34-liter backpack to a single 46-liter one. After the COVID lockdown, I reduced further to a 40-liter pack and finally to a 32-liter one.\nI didn’t become a minimalist by choice – it was forced upon me when Bianca K., her brother, and their father stole all my belongings and profited from selling them.\nToday, I see the true beginning of my minimalist journey as January 2020, when I realized in Sarajevo that less is more. My possessions shrank from around 30 kg to about 10 kg. Many minimalists own more than 30 kg, but as a nomad living out of a backpack, every additional item is an unnecessary burden. I’ve never felt the urge to buy souvenirs or indulge in consumerism. Before everything was taken from me, I had everything I needed to live.\nWith the heavy burden of the past and the confrontation with injustice without retribution, I now find solace in simplicity, carrying only what I truly need.\nIn situations like this, most people stay by the campfire, but some choose to keep walking. I chose the path of moving forward, trying to use the obstacles I encountered as stepping stones to build a new life.\nThis marked the beginning of my minimalist lifestyle, which I continue to pursue today.\nLive simply, stay humble, and live life on your own terms.\n","permalink":"https://rubenstorm.github.io/en/about/the-journey-to-my-minimalist-lifestyle/","summary":"After losing nearly all his possessions in a traumatic event, Ruben realized that sentimental items and memories couldn’t be replaced.

Since I couldn’t find anyone in Germany who believed me or wanted to help, and I was legally incapacitated at that point, the situation worsened. I felt an urgent need for a break, to escape and find peace in a quiet place. The turning point came when my landlord stood at my door and shouted, “You stupid, antisocial Russian scum, get lost where you belong”. This incident marked the moment when I had to explore my roots and embark on a journey.\nIt was the moment I packed my backpack and set off eastward, by bus, hitchhiking and walking, toward my grandparents’ land. This step was the beginning of a new life, the magnitude of which I was not yet aware. After my return, I ended up in an interview with a journalist writing an article on migration, where I was mentioned — another pivotal moment that would later radically change my life.\nIn the following months, I frequently traveled to places where I found peace, where I was not terrorized, and where I was accepted as a person. In Germany, I was incapacitated, had no rights, and was a slave who had suffered for many years under violence and terror. Being a slave in Germany in the 21st century seemed unbelievable at first, but my own experiences showed me that it was possible. This led me to question the system, and my struggle for freedom seemed hopeless.\nAfter my landlord stole all my belongings and sold them on eBay, and I lost the court case at the Waiblingen District Court, that was the point where my life transitioned into a complete nomadic existence. I was hurt and disappointed that the judge reversed the roles of victim and perpetrator and found me guilty. He ordered me into an asylum in Korb and demanded I surrender my German passport, as he could not revoke it. In the community of Korb, I had to sign a document stating that I had only one citizenship, which I had to sign at least five more times in the following months.\nGermany had deeply hurt and disappointed me. I had no rights, was placed in an asylum as an incapacitated person where I didn’t fit in, and the problems threatened to escalate. My possessions were dissolved, and I left the asylum after 24 hours. I have never returned since. At that time, I found someone who financially helped me so that I could buy a backpack and clothes — I was free. While I was still incapacitated, I had escaped slavery.\nWhen I returned to Germany at a later point in the summer of 2018, I discovered that there was an ongoing police investigation against me. As had happened before, I was being accused of things that weren’t true, though at the time, I didn’t yet know what it was about. During a phone call, I was summoned to appear at the Waiblingen police station on a specific date.\nHowever, my first visit didn’t take place because the detective in charge of the case was unavailable. I was told by his colleagues that he had called in sick that day. Before I was sent away, one of the officers acted strangely after seeing my file and had to be calmed down by his colleague.\nAt the rescheduled appointment, I was informed that a new officer had taken over the case. He led me to a room where my fingerprints were taken, photos were snapped, and I was asked to strip down. They then showed me pictures of military weapons and asked if they were mine. At the end of the interrogation, they confiscated my phone. The officer typed something into my phone while simultaneously working on the computer. I was released with the instruction to remain available, as they would contact me.\nAfter three months of hearing nothing from the police, I went back to inquire about the status of the case against me. To my surprise, no one could provide any information. I was told that there was no case and that there never had been. I was dismissed quite rudely.\nI left, unfazed by the experience, as I was already familiar with being falsely accused. I carried on with my nomadic life. This was the last instance of false accusations, and to this day, there have been no further cases.\nIn the summer of 2019, I was informed that I was supposedly free again and that the incapacitation had been lifted, but I was not interested. At that point, I was far in the east, and Germany felt far away. I had reclaimed my freedom years ago by leaving the community of Korb.\nIn August 2019, when I went to Korb to apply for a new passport, the head of the office asked me to come up to her office. Once there, she pressured me to deregister, and threatened that if I didn’t, she would completely ruin my life. She said everything I had experienced so far would be nothing in comparison to what she would do.\nI had left Korb in early 2018 after spending only 24 hours in that asylum, but I had never officially deregistered. Being threatened and coerced by a government official like that was deeply unsettling to me. In my eyes, she was not someone who should hold a position of authority in Germany. In an effort to deescalate the situation, I eventually agreed to deregister once I received my passport.\nSince that moment, I’ve had no official residence, a direct result of this coercion and the injustice I felt. I became a nomad without a permanent base, and life carried on from there.\nThis brief story narrates my journey into the life of a nomad, how I began to travel, and how my new life took shape. I have now been living as a nomad for over seven years, wandering the world.\nIf Germany hadn\u0026rsquo;t treated me this way and stripped me of my rights, and if I hadn\u0026rsquo;t lived as a “slave” with Bianca K. and her family, my life today would be completely different; I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a minimalist or a nomad.\n","permalink":"https://rubenstorm.github.io/en/about/the-path-to-my-nomadic-lifestyle/","summary":"An Unconventional Path to Freedom: From Captivity in Germany to a Self-Determined, Nomadic Life.

It can be associated with specific items like photos, art, music, or sports highlights and may include license rights for its use. NFTs are bought and sold on digital markets, but their ownership transfers are often informal and lack legal enforcement, typically serving more as status symbols than legally binding assets.\nWhat is NFT? NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are non-replicable cryptographic tokens that reside on a blockchain. NFTs can represent physical assets such as artwork and real items. By “tokenizing” these real-world tangible goods, you may make purchasing, selling, and trading them more efficient while lowering the risk of fraud.\nAre NFT worth buying? Is it a good idea to invest in NFTs? Investing in an asset solely because it has been tokenized into an NFT is a bad idea. NFTs are not investments in and of themselves, therefore be sure you understand the value of the underlying asset before purchasing the NFT.\nWhat are NFT used for? NFTs are tokens that can be used to indicate ownership of one-of-a-kind goods. They enable us to tokenize items such as art, valuables, and even real estate. The Ethereum blockchain secures asset ownership; no one can change the record of ownership or copy/paste a new NFT into existence. NFT is an abbreviation for non-fungible token.\nCan a NFT be fake? Real NFTs will have properties displayed, whereas fake NFTs will not. Next, double-check the contract address of your chosen NFT. This will reveal where it was coined. A phony NFT store may display an inaccurate minting address, whereas a true one will display the exact location where the coin was created.\nCan I touch a NFT? An NFT is a digital asset that lives entirely in the digital universe—it cannot be touched, yet it may be owned.\n","permalink":"https://rubenstorm.github.io/en/faq/nft-faq/","summary":"This FAQ section covers NFTs, which are tradeable digital assets on a blockchain, linked to items like photos, art, or music.
